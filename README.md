- 👋 Hi, I’m @Graywallis
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of stuff, currently focused on Covid vaccine QR codes
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python using Python3 and Pydroid3
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really
- 📫 How to reach me then use david@graywallis.co.uk
- Bear in mind that at the moment I'm really at the bottom of the 'Learning Curve' and will demonstrate considerable ignorance and naivete.
